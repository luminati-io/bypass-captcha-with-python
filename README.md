## CAPTCHAs: Definition and Types

A CAPTCHA (**C**ompletely **A**utomated **P**ublic **T**uring test to tell **C**omputers and **H**umans **A**part) is a challenge used to distinguish human users from bots. It requires tasks that are easy for humans but difficult for automated software.

As AI advances, CAPTCHAs have become more complex to stay effective.

Below are the most common types of CAPTCHAs in use today.

### Text CAPTCHAs

Text-based CAPTCHAs present a distorted string of letters and numbers that users must identify and input. While once widely used, bots have become better at solving them, making them less popular.

### Image CAPTCHAs

Image-based CAPTCHAs require users to select specific objects from a grid of images, such as traffic lights, bicycles, or buses. A well-known provider of these CAPTCHAs is [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/).

### Sound CAPTCHAs

Sound-based CAPTCHAs offer an accessibility option for visually impaired users. They provide an audio clip of distorted speech that must be transcribed correctly.

### Puzzle CAPTCHAs

Puzzle CAPTCHAs ask users to complete simple tasks, such as dragging an image into place or solving a logic challenge.

Popular providers include [AWS WAF CAPTCHA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-captcha-and-challenge.html) and [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/).

## Is It Possible To Automate CAPTCHAs Using Python?

CAPTCHAs are intentionally difficult to automate, and there is no simple solution in Python. However, you can approach automation in two ways:

- **Avoid CAPTCHAs** – Mimic human behavior in a controlled browser with a real-world fingerprint to reduce the chances of triggering CAPTCHAs.  
- **Use CAPTCHA Solving Services** – Outsource CAPTCHA challenges to premium services that leverage AI, automation tools, or human solvers.

To implement these methods, you'll need a Python CAPTCHA solver or bypass solution.

## Evaluating CAPTCHA Bypass Python Solutions

Here are the main elements to examine when comparing the best CAPTCHA bypass Python services on the market:

* **Capabilities**: The features and functionality provided by the solution.
* **Nature**: Whether the tool is open source or premium.
* **Uptime**: The percentage of availability guaranteed by the provider.
* **Success rate**: The ability to solve CAPTCHA challenges, expressed as a percentage.
* **CAPTCHA bypass strategy**: Whether the solution avoids CAPTCHAs, solves them, or both.
* **Supported CAPTCHA providers**: The list of all CAPTCHA providers the service can handle.
* **Trustpilot score**: The average score of reviews left by users on Trustpilot.
* **Pricing**: The cost of the Python CAPTCHA solver.
